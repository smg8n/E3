INTRODUCTION
------------
The goal of this homework is to become familiar with semaphores in the Unix operating system. 

COMPILATION
-----------
To compile, open a new CLI window, change the 
directory nesting your module. Type:

  make


EXECUTION
---------
To generate test data into a file use below command (it will generate 64 numbers in input.data ):
    ./genRandomData input.data 64

To run it simply type: ./master input.data

If no arguments are provided, it will print
  usage master <input file> 
  
To run command line arguments:
  ./master [-h] 
 
  - h Print a help message and exit.	
  
Comparison of two methods:
---------------------------

Method 1 (n/2 pairs) completed in 23 seconds and 977550 micro seconds
Method 2 (n/log n groups) completed in 15 seconds and 10239 micro seconds

By comparing these two methods, the difference is nearly 8 seconds and 967311 microseconds.
So, Method 2 takes less time compared to Method 1.

Version Control
----------------------
For Version Control i have used github.
/classes/OS/merugu/merugu.3/git_log
